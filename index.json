Previously, nearly-linear time solvers were developed for simplicial complexes with known collapsing sequences and bounded Betti numbers, such as those triangulating a three-ball in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (Cohen, Fasy, Miller, Nayyeri, Peng, and Walkington [SODA'2014], Black, Maxwell, Nayyeri, and Winkelman [SODA'2022], Black and Nayyeri [ICALP'2022]). Furthermore, Nested Dissection provides quadratic time solvers for more general systems with nonzero structures representing well-shaped simplicial complexes embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We generalize the specialized solvers for $1$-Laplacians to simplicial complexes with additional geometric structures but \\emph{without collapsing sequences and bounded Betti numbers}, and we improve the runtime of Nested Dissection. We focus on simplicial complexes that meet two conditions:(1) each individual simplex has a bounded aspect ratio, and (2) they can be divided into \"disjoint\" and balanced regions with well-shaped interiors and boundaries. Our solvers draw inspiration from the Incomplete Nested Dissection for stiffness matrices of well-shaped trusses (Kyng, Peng, Schwieterman, and Zhang [STOC'2018]).","tags":[],"title":"Efficient 1-Laplacian Solvers for Well-Shaped Simplicial Complexes: Beyond Betti Numbers and Collapsing Sequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ming Ding","Rasmus Kyng","Maximilian Probst Gutenberg","Peng Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Combinatorial Laplacians play a crucial role in homology and are a central tool in topology. Beyond this, they have various applications in data analysis and physical modeling problems. It is known that nearly-linear time solvers exist for graph Laplacians. However, nearly-linear time solvers for combinatorial Laplacians are only known for restricted classes of complexes. This paper shows that linear equations in combinatorial Laplacians of 2-complexes are as hard to solve as general linear equations. More precisely, for any constant c ≥ 1, if we can solve linear equations in combinatorial Laplacians of 2-complexes up to high accuracy in time O˜((# of nonzero coefficients)^c), then we can solve general linear equations with polynomially bounded integer coefficients and condition numbers up to high accuracy in time O˜((# of nonzero coefficients)^c). We prove this by a nearly-linear time reduction from general linear equations to combinatorial Laplacians of 2-complexes. Our reduction preserves the sparsity of the problem instances up to poly-logarithmic factors.","tags":[],"title":"Hardness Results for Laplacians of Simplicial Complexes via Sparse-Linear Equation Complete Gadgets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ming Ding","Rasmus Kyng","Peng Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Under mild assumptions similar to those employed by modern fast solvers for linear programs, our reduction causes only a polylogarithmic multiplicative increase in the size of the program, and runs in nearly-linear time. Our reduction applies to high-accuracy approximation algorithms and exact algorithms. Given an approximate solution to the 2-commodity flow problem, we can extract a solution to the linear program in linear time with only a polynomial factor increase in the error. This implies that any algorithm that solves the 2-commodity flow problem can solve linear programs in essentially the same time. Given a directed graph with edge capacities and two source-sink pairs, the goal of the 2-commodity flow problem is to maximize the sum of the flows routed between the two source-sink pairs subject to edge capacities and flow conservation. A 2-commodity flow problem can be formulated as a linear program, which can be solved to high accuracy in almost the current matrix multiplication time (Cohen-Lee-Song JACM’21). Our reduction shows that linear programs can be approximately solved, to high accuracy, using 2-commodity flow as well. Our proof follows the outline of Itai’s polynomial-time reduction of a linear program to a 2-commodity flow problem (JACM’78). Itai’s reduction shows that exactly solving 2-commodity flow and exactly solving linear programming are polynomial-time equivalent. We improve Itai’s reduction to nearly preserve the problem representation size in each step. In addition, we establish an error bound for approximately solving each intermediate problem in the reduction, and show that the accumulated error is polynomially bounded. We remark that our reduction does not run in strongly polynomial time and that it is open whether 2-commodity flow and linear programming are equivalent in strongly polynomial time.","tags":[],"title":"Two-Commodity Flow is Equivalent to Linear Programming under Nearly-Linear Time Reductions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ming Ding","Tianyu Wang","Xudong Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Such a relationship is explored over large-scale users in this article. Based on energy consumption data, where each users’ feature vector is represented by energy breakdown on hardware components of different apps, User Behavior Models (UBM) are established to capture user behavior patterns (i.e., app preference, usage time). The challenge lies in the high diversity of user behaviors (i.e., massive apps and usage ways), which leads to high dimension and dispersion of data. To overcome the challenge, three mechanisms are designed. First, to reduce the dimension, apps are ranked with the top ones identified as typical apps to represent all. Second, the dispersion is reduced by scaling each users’ feature vector with typical apps to unit ℓ1 norm. The scaled vector becomes Usage Pattern, while the ℓ1 norm of vector before scaling is treated as Usage Intensity. Third, the usage pattern is analyzed with a two-layer clustering approach to further reduce data dispersion. In the upper layer, each typical app is studied across its users with respect to hardware components to identify Typical Hardware Usage Patterns (THUP). In the lower layer, users are studied with respect to these THUPs to identify Typical App Usage Patterns (TAUP). The analytical results of these two layers are consolidated into Usage Pattern Models (UPM), and UBMs are finally established by a union of UPMs and Usage Intensity Distributions (UID). By carrying out experiments on energy consumption data from 18,308 distinct users over 10 days, 33 UBMs are extracted from training data. With the test data, it is proven that these UBMs cover 94% user behaviors and achieve up to 20% improvement in accuracy of energy representation, as compared with the baseline method, PCA. Besides, potential applications and implications of these UBMs are illustrated for smartphone manufacturers, app developers, network providers, and so on.","tags":[],"title":"Establishing Smartphone User Behavior Model Based on Energy Consumption Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
